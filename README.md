Sticky Footer
=============

HTML5 implementation of a Sticky Footer

## Usage
You must have a `<header>`, a `<main>` and a `<footer>` elements in your page.
Include the content of `style.css` into your own CSS file.

You can use Less or Sass variables to define both header and footer sizes.

If you're using Frameworks like FOX or .NET, add `form` along with `html` and `body` as hinted in `style.css`.
